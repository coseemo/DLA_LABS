# Deep Learning Applications Laboratories


## Overview

Repository that contains the three laboratories for the Deep Learning Applications exam. The choosen laboratories are:

 - `lab1/`: MLP, CNN, Residual Connections and Distillation.
 - `lab3/`: Transformers, Fine-Tuning, LoRa and exercise 3.3.
 - `lab4/`: FGSM, JARN
 
 In each project's folder, you can found:
 - README file in which I show and explain the made experiments and the obtained results
 - `configs/` directory that contains the .yaml configuration files that i used for experiments 

These are the wandb repositories for each lab:
-   **lab1:** [https://wandb.ai/cosimo-borghini1-universit-di-firenze/LAB1-CNN?nw=nwusercosimoborghini1](https://wandb.ai/AI-UNIFI/DLA_LAB_1?nw=nwusermirkobicchierai)
-    **lab3:** [https://wandb.ai/cosimo-borghini1-universit-di-firenze/LAB3-Transformers?nw=nwusercosimoborghini1](https://wandb.ai/AI-UNIFI/DLA_LAB_1?nw=nwusermirkobicchierai)
-    **lab4:** [https://wandb.ai/cosimo-borghini1-universit-di-firenze/Lab4-OOD_Detection?nw=nwusercosimoborghini1](https://wandb.ai/AI-UNIFI/DLA_LAB_1?nw=nwusermirkobicchierai)
